  - Separate tabs for bar (alcohol, cocktails) and food menus.  
  - Modifiers support (e.g., “no onions,” “extra olives”) with dynamic price adjustments.  
  - Pre-built cocktail recipes (e.g., “Mojito: 2 oz rum, 1 lime, mint”) to standardize preparation.  
- **Check Splitting & Payment Processing**:  
  - Split checks by item or evenly, with customizable portion labels (e.g., “Group A,” “Group B”).  
  - Support for cash, card (Stripe/Braintree), digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay), and split payments across methods.  
  - Auto-calculate taxes (configurable by location, e.g., 8% sales tax + 2% liquor tax) and tips (customizable percentages).  
- **Real-Time Order Tracking**:  
  - Kitchen/Bar dashboard showing order status (pending, preparing, ready, served).  
  - Push notifications to staff devices (e.g., “Order #123: Cocktail ‘Mojito’ ready”).  
  - Digital ticket printers for kitchen/bar (optional hardware integration).  

#### **B. Inventory & Purchasing**  
- **Multi-Category Stock Tracking**:  
  - Track beverages (alcohol, soft drinks), ingredients (juices, syrups), glassware, and supplies (ice, napkins).

- **Smart Reorder Engine**:  
  - Automated low-stock alerts (email/SMS) when inventory hits predefined thresholds.  
  - Reorder suggestions based on historical usage (e.g., “Rum uses 50 bottles/week; reorder 75 bottles now”).  
  - Lead-time consideration (e.g., “Supplier X takes 3 days; reorder by Friday”).  
- **Supplier Management**:  
  - Centralized supplier profiles with contact details, delivery schedules, and performance metrics (on-time delivery rate).  
  - Purchase order (PO) generation with auto-filled items, quantities, and delivery dates; POs emailable or printable.  

#### **C. Table & Customer Management**  
- **Digital Reservation System**:  
  - Customer self-service booking via web/app (with date/time selection and party size).

  - Targeted notifications via SMS/email/app (e.g., “John, your favorite whiskey is 20% off today!”).  
- **Feedback & Sentiment Analysis**:  
  - Post-meal surveys (in-app, SMS, or email) with NPS (Net Promoter Score) and rating questions.

### **4. Pain Points Addressed**  

- **Order Errors**:  
  - Modifiers and pre-built recipes reduce ambiguity (e.g., “no onions” auto-flagged for kitchen).  
  - Real-time order tracking and ticket printers ensure BOH teams receive accurate, up-to-date instructions.  

- **Stock Inefficiencies**:  
  - Automated low-stock alerts prevent out-of-stocks (e.g., “ice machine low” triggers reorder).  
  - Reorder suggestions based on usage patterns (e.g., “tequila usage spikes 20% during weekends”) optimize procurement.  

- **Staff Mismanagement**:  
  - Role-based scheduling aligns staff with demand (e.g., more bartenders during happy hour).  
  - Time-clock geofencing and photo verification eliminate buddy-punching and manual errors.  

- **Poor Customer Experience**:  
  - Personalized profiles (e.g., “remember Mr. Lee’s no onions”) build loyalty.  
  - Waitlist SMS alerts reduce customer wait anxiety and improve table turnover.  

- **Compliance Risks**:  
  - ID scanning and DOB checks prevent underage alcohol sales (legal compliance).  
  - Licensing reminders and safety logs avoid fines (e.g., expired liquor license).
